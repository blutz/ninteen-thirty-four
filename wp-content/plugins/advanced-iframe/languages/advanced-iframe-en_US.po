"\n"
"      <h3>What are jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"      jQuery selectors are one of the most important aspects of the jQuery "
"library. These selectors use familiar CSS syntax to allow page authors to "
"quickly and easily identify any set of page elements to operate upon with "
"the jQuery library methods. Understanding jQuery selectors is the key to "
"using the jQuery library most effectively. The selector is a string "
"expression that identifies the set of DOM elements that will be collected "
"into a matched set to be operated upon by the jQuery methods.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"      <h3>Types of jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>The \"Basic Selectors\" are known as \"find selectors\" as they are "
"used to find elements within the DOM. The \"Positional\" and \"Custom "
"Selectors\" are \"filter selectors\" as they filter a set of elements (which "
"defaults to the entire set of elements in the DOM). This extract will focus "
"on the basic selectors as they are most important and will cover most of "
"your needs.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Basic CSS Selectors</h4>\n"
"      <p>These selectors follow standard CSS3 syntax and semantics. For more "
"selectors and examples go to <a href=\"https://api.jquery.com/category/"

"Wordpress you need to <b>replace [...] them with {{ ... }}</b></li>\n"
"       </ol>\n"
"       <b>Examples:</b>\n"
"       <ul>\n"
"         <li>$(\"div\") -> div</li>\n"
"          <li>$(\"#id1\") -> #id1</li>\n"
"         <li>$(\"p:has(b)\") -> p:has(b)</li>\n"
"         <li>$(\"a[href$=.pdf]\") -> a{{href$=.pdf}}</li> \n"

"Normally (Default (Scroll)) the iframes are loaded lazy after the settings "

"If you don't have the rights to use auto height you can use <a href="

"the browser. This is pretty cool and can be configured by pressing the \"Add "
"breakpoint\" link. There you can define the x, y, width, height and iframe "
"width for a certain browser width (breakpoint). See the descriptions before "
"for a description of this values. You always define the upper width of a "
"breakpoint. So if you want to optimize your iframe for mobile, table, "

"the width of the iframe itself to 100% to have it responsive because it will "

"the breakpoint width when you reach this value or the iframe width if you "
"define one. You can use the area selector by entering the breakpoint or "
"iframe with for this breakpoint as width and select the new area. Please "
"check the example for a full explanation. If you want to define this in a "

"separated by |. e.g. show_part_of_iframe_media_query=\"80|100|800|600|"
